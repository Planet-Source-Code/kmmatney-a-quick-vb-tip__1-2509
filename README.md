## A quick VB tip


</div>

### Description

This is not code but a simple tip. To easily move one or more controls around the screen, simply select the control(s), then press the arrow keys while holding down the ctrl key. Use the arrow keys along with the shift key to resize controls. I find this gives me much better control than using the mouse.

Note: This also works with "locked" controls, which can't be moved by the mouse. Very useful if you tend to lock the controls on your form a lot.
 
### More Info
 
This works in VB 5 and VB 6, I do not know about earlier versions.
